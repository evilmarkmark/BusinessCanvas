Business Model Canvas Template
===========================

This is template for Alex Osterwilder's Business Model Canvas

http://www.businessmodelgeneration.com/canvas

it is a tool for quick and fairly easy clarification of business models.

Original canvas is good for showing and analyzing existing businesses, however for startups, I found Ash Maurya's one, a little bit more convenient:

Idea is that you will fork this, use it to analyze your ideas. Make versions old fashion way, by copying so you can display your idea evolution more easily.

I provided two alternative templates, layouts: canvas.html and startup.html

I have to mention existing online tools as well, however I do believe this and paper to be superior.

Here is one from Ash Maurya's Spark59:
